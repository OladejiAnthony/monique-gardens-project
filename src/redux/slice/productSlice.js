//JS push () method -
//In JavaScript, the push() method is used to add one or more elements to the
//end of an array, effectively modifying the original array.
//It modifies the array in place and returns the new length of the array after the elements have been added.
//The push() method is commonly used when you need to add new elements to
//the end of an array dynamically, such as when collecting data or appending items to a list.
//It's a convenient way to modify arrays in JavaScript.

//JS Math Object -
//In JavaScript, the Math object provides a set of built-in mathematical operations and constants.
//These methods and properties allow you to perform common mathematical tasks, such as
//rounding numbers, generating random numbers, and performing trigonometric calculations, among others.
//Here are some commonly used methods and properties of the Math object -
//Math.round(), Math.floor(), Math.random(), Math.max(), Math.min(), Math.pow() etc
